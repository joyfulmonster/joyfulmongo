# Requirements

Implement an in-memory hashmap that put and read Key Value pairs.  It should be highly scalable and safe.

# Analysis

## Components of HashMap

HashMap is a well known data structure that provides O(1) read/write performance.  There are three main components for a hashmap:

* hash function
* collision resolution
* storage resizing

## Standard Implemenations

Java JDK provides three implemenations:

* java.util.HashMap
* java.util.Hashtable
* java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap

Issues with these implemenations:



* java.util.HashMap is not thread safe.
* java.util.Hashtable is
